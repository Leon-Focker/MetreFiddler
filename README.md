# MetreFiddler

This Plugin is built using the [nih_plug framework](https://github.com/robbert-vdh/nih-plug) with a GUI powered by vizia.

## Building

In the future, precompiled binaries can be found in the [Releases tab](https://github.com/Leon-Focker/MetreFiddler/releases/)

After installing [Rust](https://rustup.rs/), you can compile MetreFiddler yourself as follows:

```shell
cargo xtask bundle metrefiddler --release
```
